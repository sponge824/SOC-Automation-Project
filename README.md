# SOC Automation Project

## Objective

This Lab aimed to design and build an automated workflow similar to a Next-Gen Security Operation Centre (SOC). It leverages a SIEM, an automation platform, and AI to handle the initial investigation of a security alert automatically. The system triages, enriches with threat intelligence, summarises, and reports on alerts, which reduces the workload for L1 analysts.

### Skills Learned

- **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)**: Designing and implementing an end-to-end automation pipeline to connect different security tools.
- **SIEM Implementation & Management**: Deploying, configuring, and managing Splunk for log ingestion, searching, and alerting.
- **API Integration**: Connecting Gemini, AbuseIPDB, and Slack through their APIs to automate the workflow. 
- **Threat Intelligence**: Used AbuseIPDB to enrich the IOC.
- **VM**: Building and managing multi-VM environments using VMware, such as Windows and Ubuntu.
- **Docker**: Deploying and managing application (N8N) using Docker.

### Tools Used
- **Splunk**: SIEM Platform
- **N8N**: Core automation and workflow engine
- **Gemini**: AI analysis and reporting
- **AbuseIPDB**: IP Address threat intelligence enrichment
- **VMWare**: Lab Environment
- **Docker**: Deployment of N8N
- **Slack**: Automated Alert Notifications
- **OS**: Windows 10 (Log Source) & Ubuntu Server (Splunk, N8N)
